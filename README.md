# Lunch Lady AutoSplitter

## Parameters

- ### Start on Lamp 

  Starts the timer when your lamp turns on.

- ### Split on Book 

  When you grab a book your timer splits (For the nerds who needs to check their average sec / book time).

- ### Reset on Restart Map 

  Your timer resets when you restarts the map, if you get a PB (Or Best Split) you'll have to save your splits manually before the autosplitter resets.
  
- ### End on HUD Change 

  This is the Safe Way to end timer (safe = Working in Solo AND Multi (Kinda)) But ~.7sec delay on LiveSplit Timer End
  
- ### End when back in Spawn

  **[SOLO ONLY]** The timer is ending when you grabbed 10 books and go back in spawn to leave. No Delay on LiveSplit Timer End
