# Lunch Lady AutoSplitter

## Parameters

- ### Start on Lamp 

  Starts the timer when your lamp turns on.

- ### Split on Book 

  When you grab a book your timer splits (For the nerds who needs to check their average sec / book time).

- ### Reset on Restart Map 

  Your timer resets when you restarts the map, if you get a PB (Or Best Split) you'll have to save your splits manually before the autosplitter resets.
  
  
  

## To do : 
### Get an accurate stop timer time (Currently ~0.7sec late)
